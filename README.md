# My Awesome Project
This is my mock-up version of the Japanese Women Leadership Institute website. I flexed my knowledge of responsive web design in the creation of this project.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, Responsive CSS

After practicing with several projects using HTML & CSS layout, I took things a step further and made my page responsive. 

## Lessons Learned:
Making content decisions as my viewport decreased was probably the hardest part of this project. It's easier to adjust the size of things as you shrink the screen compared to deciding when things need to be removed. At first I was tempted to keep as much as possible because I worked so hard to create it, but remembering that I need to keep user needs in mind helped me decide what needed to be removed.
